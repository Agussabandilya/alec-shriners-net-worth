##  From Spokesperson to Sportscaster: What's Alec Doing Now? 

Alec Cabacungan isn't just that remarkable kid from the Shriners commercials anymore—he's all grown up and pursuing his passions!  Remember how he bravely confronted brittle bone disease, enduring more than 60 fractures? He took those very challenges and transformed them into strength, becoming a powerful spokesperson for Shriners Hospitals for Children. Alec used his story to raise awareness and showed the world what true resilience looks like.

These days, you can find Alec on a different kind of stage. He's traded in the hospital visits for the dynamic world of sports broadcasting at Northwestern University. It's no surprise that someone with his charisma and passion would gravitate towards storytelling. But Alec's mission goes beyond just calling plays; he's still a fierce advocate for inclusivity. He's using his platform, now larger than ever, to dismantle barriers for people with disabilities and show them that anything is possible.

Alec's journey is a shining example of how resilience and determination can lead to amazing things. He's not defined by his past struggles but empowered by them.  He's a reminder that limitations are often self-imposed, and with enough heart, we can turn our biggest challenges into our greatest triumphs. 

## Does Alec Get Paid for Those Shriners Commercials? 

It's no secret that Shriners Hospitals for Children rely heavily on donations to keep their doors open and provide life-changing care to children in need. So, it's natural to wonder: does Alec Cabacungan, the familiar face of many Shriners commercials, receive compensation for his appearances?

As a non-profit organization, Shriners manages its finances with careful consideration, ensuring that every dollar is maximized for the benefit of the children they serve. However, they also understand the profound impact of a compelling spokesperson. Alec, as a former patient who has directly benefited from their care, likely resonates more deeply with audiences than a traditional advertisement ever could. 

While Shriners understandably keeps the specifics of their financial arrangements confidential, it's reasonable to assume that Alec receives some form of compensation for his role as a spokesperson. It might not be a Hollywood-level salary, but it likely contributes to his and his family's well-being. Additionally, being the "face" of Shriners probably comes with other perks, such as travel opportunities and a prominent platform to share his story.

However, there's another perspective to consider. Alec, as a former patient, has a deeply personal connection to Shriners. The organization played a pivotal role in his healing and journey. It's highly plausible that his desire to give back and help other children facing similar challenges is a significant motivating factor for his involvement. While financial compensation might be a factor, it's probably not the sole driving force. 

The truth is, the exact financial arrangement between Alec and Shriners remains undisclosed. And that's perfectly fine. The most important takeaway is that his story resonates with people from all walks of life, raising awareness for a worthy cause and ultimately helping more children receive the vital care they deserve. 

##  Alec's College Journey: Where is He Now? 

Alec Cabacungan, the remarkable young man you might remember from those Shriners commercials, has traded in the spotlight for the classroom. That's right, he's off to college now!  You can find him at Northwestern University, working towards a degree in journalism.  It seems like just yesterday he was inspiring us all with his resilience and advocacy for kids facing disabilities, and now he's taking on the world of news and storytelling. 

Moving from being a spokesperson to navigating college life is no small feat.  Imagine balancing demanding classes with continuing his advocacy work—talk about impressive! But Alec seems to be taking it all in stride, always focused on using his voice to lift others up. It's a testament to the power of determination! If Alec can overcome challenges with such unwavering resolve, what's stopping the rest of us from chasing our dreams?
